"""Contract tests for the mutation-testing caller workflow.

The executable logic lives in the ``leynos/shared-actions`` reusable
workflow (mutation-mutmut.yml), which carries its own unit and
integration tests; lading's caller is declarative configuration. These
tests parse the caller with PyYAML and pin the contract it must uphold,
so drift (repointing the pin at a branch, widening permissions, or
losing the flat-layout configuration) fails CI on the pull request
rather than surfacing in a scheduled or manual run.
