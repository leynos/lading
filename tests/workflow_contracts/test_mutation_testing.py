"""Contract tests for the mutation-testing caller workflow.

The executable logic lives in the ``leynos/shared-actions`` reusable
workflow (mutation-mutmut.yml), which carries its own unit and
integration tests; lading's caller is declarative configuration. These
tests parse the caller with PyYAML and pin the contract it must uphold,
so drift (repointing the pin at a branch, widening permissions, or
losing the flat-layout configuration) fails CI on the pull request
rather than surfacing in a scheduled or manual run.

The caller must reference the correct reusable workflow at a commit SHA;
Dependabot owns the SHA value, so these tests assert the shape of the
pin (the workflow path and a full 40-hex commit SHA) rather than the
specific commit.
